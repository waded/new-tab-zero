## Planned improvements

- Adapt to your preference for dark mode in the browser. Until Chrome & Edge support
  detecting this (<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme>)
  new tabs are gray instead of white/black.
- Inverted icons for dark mode (waiting on
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=893175>)
- Localization of "New tab"
