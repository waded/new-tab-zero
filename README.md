# minimalist-new-tab

This is a Chrome/Edge extension that removes all distractions on new tabs. No news, no weather, no favorite sites, no clocks, no photos. Nothing but space.

If you want to search, or go to recent/favorite sites, just type in the address bar.

## Published versions

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimalist-new-tab/jlfccaehbgdjemooelbpkmnogjacnjbf)

## Planned improvements

- Adjust to your preference for dark mode (waiting for [support
  for detecting the mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme), and until then
  new tabs are gray instead of light/dark)
- Invert icons in dark mode (waiting [for support in manifest or automatically](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=893175), rather than adding a preference specific to this extension)
- Localization of "New tab"
