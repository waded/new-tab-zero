# minimalist-new-tab

A Chrome & Edge extension that removes distractions on new tabs.

If you want to search, or go to a recent or favorite sites, just type in
the address bar. Your cursor's already there.

## Planned improvements

- Options for sites to adapt to user's preference for "dark  mode" will allow
  automatic choice of a dark vs. light background on the new tabs.
  Until this is possible (Chrome >=75) new tabs are a neutral gray to keep things
  simple. Although gray's not ideal it won't blind you or shove you into darkness
  unexpectedly.
